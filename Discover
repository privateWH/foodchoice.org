Today I was at Pho Van in Beaverton Town Square. 
I learned something about discovery.
A choice to me is something I like. that might means pho, egg noodle, or other things that I have known prior.
Today I look at the menu once again, I think maybe change the searching criteria, let's start with pricing, something exotic. 
While looking at the choices, I think about what things my wife would want. She said she like chicken during Chinese New Year, and I thought about we will have Burger tomorrow. 
And she probably had so many pork. so I ordered a Chicken Lemongrass for her.
For my self, I choose exotic and pricy. the justification is this, you can gamble for something and the ingredients seems appealing, by normal standard it shouldn't be too bad.
Plus it is a vietnamnese dish. so I picked.
